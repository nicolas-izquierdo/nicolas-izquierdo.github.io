Welcome! My name is Nicolás Izquierdo and I am a Master's student in Social Sciences at the 
[Carlos III–Juan March Institute (IC3JM)](https://ic3jm.es/en/postgraduates/master-degree-social-sciences/). 
I also hold both a degree in [Law (LL.B.)](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/law) 
and a degree in [Political Science (B.A.)](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/political-science) 
from the University Carlos III of Madrid.  

My research interests fall in the intersection of comparative and historical political economy. 
My work focuses on the political economy of democratic class conflict — how the competing interests 
of workers, firms, and the state shape institutional design, patterns of representation, 
and distributive outcomes.
