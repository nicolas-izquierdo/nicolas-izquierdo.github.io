Welcome! My name is Nicolás Izquierdo and I am a Master's student in Social Sciences at the 
[Carlos III–Juan March Institute (IC3JM)](https://ic3jm.es/en/postgraduates/master-degree-social-sciences/). 
I also hold both degrees in [Law (LL.B.)](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/law) 
and [Political Science (B.A.)](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/political-science) 
from the University Carlos III of Madrid.  

My research interests lie in comparative political economy and labor politics, encompassing issues of workers’ political representation, collective action, and redistribution. In particular, I am interested in how labor mobilization shapes policy outcomes and public opinion across democracies. I also study topics in judicial behavior, focusing on how private economic interests affect judicial decision-making.

You can find my full CV [here](/CV-nicolas-izquierdo-11-25.pdf).
